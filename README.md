## Simple React exercise

Please use the following two endpoints:

- https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts
- https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users

### Here is the task:

- please use the base `create-react-app` project from this repo
- branch off the `master` branch and commit all your code this new branch
- create all the React components required to display the list of posts, as per the design below
- the post cards should be selectable, selected cards should change background color and apply the 'tick' to the checkbox in the right-hand top corner
- you have full freedom in terms of how many components you want to create and how you want to build them
- try to stick as close to the provided design as possible
- responsivness and mobile-first development will be a bonus
